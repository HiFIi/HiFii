        This is Kinley! She is a sweet little girl who loves to play in the mud/water
        and anything that gets her dirty. \n \nShe likes to gives lots of hugs and kisses, play with her 3-legged bro Wylee,
    and bark at airplanes and such because she is weird. \n \n She is such a beautiful and intelligent girl, and the perfect
    companion for Wylee as he advances in age and becomes a grumpy old dog.</string>
